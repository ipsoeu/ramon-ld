    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This division includes the transformation of crude petroleum and coal into usable products. The dominant process is petroleum refining, which involves the separation of crude petroleum into component products through such techniques as cracking and distillation. This division includes the manufacture of gases such as ethane, propane and butane as products of petroleum refineries.</skos:definition>
