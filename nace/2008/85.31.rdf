    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This class includes provision of the type of education that lays the foundation for lifelong learning and human development and is capable of furthering education opportunities. Such units provide programmes that are usually on a more subject-oriented pattern using more specialised teachers, and more often employ several teachers conducting classes in their field of specialisation. Subject specialisation at this level often begins to have some influence even on the educational experience of those pursuing a general programme. Such programmes are designated to qualify students either for technical and vocational education or for entrance to higher education without any special subject prerequisite. This class includes: - lower general secondary education corresponding more or less to the period of compulsory school attendance - upper general secondary education giving, in principle, access to higher education</skos:definition>
