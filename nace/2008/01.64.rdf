    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This class includes all post-harvest activities aimed at improving the propagation quality of seed through the removal of non-seed materials, undersized, mechanically or insect-damaged and immature seeds as well as removing the seed moisture to a safe level for seed storage. This activity includes the drying, cleaning, grading and treating of seeds until they are marketed. The treatment of genetically modified seeds is included here.</skos:definition>
