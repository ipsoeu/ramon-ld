    <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Recovery of sorted materials</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This class includes the processing of metal and non-metal waste and scrap and other articles into secondary raw materials, usually involving a mechanical or chemical transformation process. Examples of the mechanical or chemical transformation processes that are undertaken are: - mechanical crushing of metal waste from used cars, washing machines, bikes etc. - mechanical reduction of large iron pieces such as railway wagons - shredding of metal waste, end-of-life vehicles etc. - other methods of mechanical treatment as cutting, pressing to reduce the volume - reclaiming metals out of photographic waste, e.g. fixer solution or photographic films and paper - reclaiming of rubber such as used tyres to produce secondary raw material - sorting and pelleting of plastics to produce secondary raw material for tubes, flower pots, pallets and the like - processing (cleaning, melting, grinding) of plastic or rubber waste to granulates - crushing, cleaning and sorting of glass - crushing, cleaning and sorting of other waste such as demolition waste to obtain secondary raw material - processing of used cooking oils and fats into secondary raw materials - processing of other food, beverage and tobacco waste and residual substances into secondary raw materials</skos:definition>
