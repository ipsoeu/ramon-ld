    <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Specialised construction activities</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This division includes specialised construction activities (special trades), i.e. the construction of parts of buildings and civil engineering works or preparation therefore. These activities are usually specialised in one aspect common to different structures, requiring specialised skills or equipment, such as pile-driving, foundation work, carcass work, concrete work, brick laying, stone setting, scaffolding, roof covering, etc. The erection of steel structures is included, provided that the parts are not produced by the same unit. Specialised construction activities are mostly carried out under subcontract, but especially in repair construction it is done directly for the owner of the property. Included is the installation of all kind of utilities that make the construction function as such. These activities are usually performed at the site of the construction, although parts of the job may be carried out in a special shop. Included are activities such as plumbing, installation of heating and air-conditioning systems, antennas, alarm systems and other electrical work, sprinkler systems, elevators and escalators, etc. Also included are insulation work (water, heat, sound), sheet metal work, commercial refrigerating work, the installation of illumination and signalling systems for roads, railways, airports, harbours, etc. Also repair of the same type as the above mentioned activities is included. Building completion activities encompass activities that contribute to the completion or finishing of a construction such as glazing, plastering, painting, floor and wall tiling or covering with other materials like parquet, carpets, wallpaper, etc., floor sanding, finish carpentry, acoustical work, cleaning of the exterior, etc. Also repair of the same type as the above mentioned activities is included. The rental of equipment with operator is classified with the associated construction activity.</skos:definition>
