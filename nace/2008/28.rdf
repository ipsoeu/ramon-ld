    <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This division includes the manufacture of machinery and equipment that act independently on materials either mechanically or thermally or perform operations on materials (such as handling, spraying, weighing or packing), including their mechanical components that produce and apply force, and any specially manufactured primary parts. This includes the manufacture of fixed and mobile or hand-held devices, regardless of whether they are designed for industrial, building and civil engineering, agricultural or home use. The manufacture of special equipment for passenger or freight transport within demarcated premises also belongs within this division. This division distinguishes between the manufacture of special-purpose machinery, i.e. machinery for exclusive use in a NACE industry or a small cluster of NACE industries, and general-purpose machinery, i.e. machinery that is being used in a wide range of NACE industries.</skos:definition>
