    <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Retail trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This division includes the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods mainly to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilisation, by shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers, consumer cooperatives etc. Retail trade is classified first by type of sale outlet (retail trade in stores: groups 47.1 to 47.7; retail trade not in stores: groups 47.8 and 47.9). Retail trade in stores includes the retail sale of used goods (class 47.79). For retail sale in stores, there exists a further distinction between specialised retail sale (groups 47.2 to 47.7) and non-specialised retail sale (group 47.1). The above groups are further subdivided by the range of products sold. Sale not via stores is subdivided according to the forms of trade, such as retail sale via stalls and markets (group 47.8) and other non-store retail sale, e.g. mail order, door-to-door, by vending machines etc. (group 47.9). The goods sold in this division are limited to goods usually referred to as consumer goods or retail goods. Therefore goods not normally entering the retail trade, such as cereal grains, ores, industrial machinery etc. are excluded.</skos:definition>
