    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This subcategory includes: - processing services of non-metal waste and scrap and of non-metal articles, whether or not used, into secondary raw material. Typical input consists of waste and scrap being sorted or unsorted but always unfit for further direct use in an industrial process, whereas the output is made fit for further processing and is to be considered then as an intermediate good. A process is required, either mechanical or chemical. Examples are: &#x2022; reclaiming of rubber such as used tires to produce secondary raw material &#x2022; sorting and pelleting of plastics to produce secondary raw material for tubes, flower pots, pallets and the like &#x2022; reclaiming of chemicals from chemical waste &#x2022; crushing, cleaning and sorting of glass &#x2022; crushing, cleaning and sorting of other waste such as demolition waste to obtain secondary raw material</skos:definition>
