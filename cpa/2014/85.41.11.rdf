    <skos:definition xml:lang="all">This subcategory includes: - on-line educational services for programmes (ISCED Level 4) which, while happening after students finish upper secondary education, they cannot be considered tertiary education because content-wise these programmes are not significantly more advanced than those from upper secondary. They are either short vocational programmes that lead students to the labour market or programmes with substantial theoretical background instruction specifically designed to prepare students for entry to tertiary education in cases where they had previously followed a curriculum (in Level 3 above) that lacked elements needed to entitle them to enter tertiary education programmes. Services in this subcategory cover education which is not designed explicitly to prepare participants for a specific class of occupations or trades or for entry into further vocational or technical education programmes.</skos:definition>
